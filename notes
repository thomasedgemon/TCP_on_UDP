**tcp-style stream semantics over udp.

Transmission Control Protocol;
tcp means 
-reliable delivery - checksum, hash sent and recieved, compare?
-in-order delivery - don't send another packet until the previous is recieved. 
-byte stream abstraction -- continuous flow rather than data chunks
-flow control -- recipient tells sender how much buffer space it has. sender can
-congestion control -- sender assumes nothing about network, then slowly increases data packet size until there's a loss. 
-conn mgmt

User Datagram Protocol
basics of udp:
-no handshake or session
-no guarantee packet will arrive, arrive once, or arrive in order. 
-each message is independent
