**tcp-style stream semantics over udp.

Transmission Control Protocol;
tcp means:
-reliable delivery - checksum, hash sent and recieved, compare?
-in-order delivery - don't send another packet until the previous is recieved. 
-byte stream abstraction -- continuous flow rather than data chunks
-flow control -- recipient tells sender how much buffer space it has. sender can
-congestion control -- sender assumes nothing about network, then slowly increases data packet size until there's a loss. 
-conn mgmt

User Datagram Protocol
basics of udp:
-no handshake or session
-no guarantee packet will arrive, arrive once, or arrive in order. 
-each message is independent



pseudocode:

sender opens file in chunks.
sender checksums entire file.
sender adds a squence number and checksum to each chunk.
sender sends chunk
sender waits for ack from recipient before sending another chunk,
  and takes flow, congestion control, recipient buffer size into consideration. 
recipient sends ack for previous chunk 
iterate until transmission is complete.
WHAT IF A CHUNK FAILS?
  -re-send that chunk 
recipient correctly orders chunks 
recipient generates checksum for entire file
recipient sends checksum to sender
transmission successful if checksum matches.
